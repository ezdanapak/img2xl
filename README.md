This is a GUI program based on tkinter module.

It allows you to choose a folder with images containing coordinates (for example drone photos taken during automated mission flights).

After choosing the folder, clicking the 'Run' button will extract coordinates and height from images and transform them into decimal degrees format;
Then it will create an Excel file and put image names, coordinates and elevations in the file.

This was needed at my former workplace to shorten the process of manually uploading images in other program, extracting coordinates and then manually cleaning Excel data.
